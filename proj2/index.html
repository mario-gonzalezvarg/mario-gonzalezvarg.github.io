    <h2 class="section-heading">1.1 Convolutions from Scratch</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A discrete convolution is defined by sliding a small kernel across an image and, at each
        location, computing a weighted sum of the local neighborhood with zero-padding so that the
        output retains the spatial dimensions of the input. This operation implements a linear,
        shift-invariant filter whose effect is determined entirely by the choice of kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experiment compares three concrete realizations of this definition: a naïve four-loop
        baseline, a partially vectorized two-loop NumPy implementation, and SciPy’s optimized
        <code>convolve2d</code>. All three are applied to the same self-portrait with a 9×9 box
        filter, so any differences in outcome can be attributed to numerical or implementation
        details rather than to the underlying operator.

        A benchmark on the 9×9 box filter, averaged over multiple runs, yields runtimes of
        approximately 9066.8&nbsp;ms for the four-loop implementation, 1634.2&nbsp;ms for the
        two-loop implementation, and 70.5&nbsp;ms for the SciPy routine. The partially vectorized
        version is therefore faster than the naïve one by a factor of about 5.5, while SciPy
        achieves a speedup of roughly 129 over the four-loop baseline and about 23 over the
        two-loop method. The timing data establish that expressing convolution in terms of large
        array operations, rather than explicit Python loops, is decisive for efficiency.

        The three filtered selfies smooth high-frequency detail in the hair, pavement, and jacket
        while preserving coarse structure such as the outline of the face and the bike rack. The
        outputs are visually indistinguishable, and any discrepancies are below the level of
        perceptual relevance. Together with the timing measurements, this shows that the custom
        NumPy implementations are numerically consistent with the library routine and differ
        principally in computational cost rather than in filtering behavior.

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        This section studies how simple finite-difference filters approximate image gradients on
        the standard cameraman photograph. A horizontal difference kernel measures local changes in
        intensity from left to right, while a vertical difference kernel measures changes from top
        to bottom. The corresponding derivative images respond strongly where the scene contains
        vertical or horizontal edges and remain close to zero in regions where intensity varies
        slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The directional derivatives are combined into a gradient-magnitude image that summarizes
        edge strength independently of direction, and a global threshold converts this continuous
        field into a binary edge map. In addition, two visualizations of gradient orientation are
        produced in color space: one relies on a fast approximation to the angle, and the other
        uses an explicit arctangent computation. Their comparison reveals both the geometric
        structure of the cameraman scene and the accuracy of the approximate orientation method
        relative to the reference.

        The derivative images, gradient magnitude, edge map, and orientation fields together
        specify the geometric information extracted by finite differences from a single grayscale

  <!-- =============================== 1.3 Derivative of Gaussian Filter ================================= -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">1.3 Derivative of Gaussian Filter</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        We now explore two strategies for computing smoothed image gradients: first blurring
        the image with a Gaussian filter and then applying finite-difference kernels, versus
        convolving once with derivative-of-Gaussian (DoG) kernels. Since convolution is linear and
        shift-invariant, differentiating the Gaussian and then convolving the result with the image
        should be equivalent, up to numerical and boundary effects, to convolving with the Gaussian
        followed by discrete differentiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Horizontal and vertical derivative-of-Gaussian kernels are constructed and applied to the
        cameraman image. The resulting directional derivatives and gradient magnitudes are
        juxtaposed with those obtained from the “smooth then difference” pipeline. The comparison
        tests whether the one-step DoG approach reproduces the same sharpened edges and reduced
        noise as the two-stage method that explicitly separates smoothing and differentiation.

    <h2 class="section-heading">2.1 Image Sharpening with Unsharp Masking</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        This section analyzes unsharp masking as a method for enhancing fine detail in a photograph
        of the Taj Mahal. The procedure forms a smoothed version of the image by convolving with a
        Gaussian blur kernel, subtracts this low-pass version from the original to isolate a
        high-pass component containing edges and textures, and then adds a scaled copy of this
        high-pass signal back to the original. The sharpened image exhibits increased local
        contrast near boundaries while largely preserving the global brightness and coloration of
        the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpreted in terms of kernels, unsharp masking combines an impulse-like identity kernel
        with a negative Gaussian to create an effective filter with a strong positive center and a
        weaker negative surround. This structure amplifies rapid spatial changes and slightly
        suppresses slowly varying regions. The intermediate visualizations of the blur, the
        extracted high-pass component, the sharpened output, and the equivalent single unsharp
        kernel clarify how the operation redistributes contrast across spatial scales.

        The Taj Mahal and vintage photograph examples together show how unsharp masking parameters
        fix the notion of “detail” that is being enhanced. A narrower blur sharpens fine
        architectural edges in a high-resolution scene, whereas a broader blur applied to the scan
        targets mid-scale structure and prevents film grain from becoming visually dominant. In
        both cases, the method operates by selectively boosting high-frequency content relative to
        a smooth background, producing images that appear more focused without resorting to a
        simple global contrast adjustment.

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A hybrid image combines the low frequencies of one photograph with the high frequencies of
        another so that perception changes with viewing distance. In this example, Derek’s face
        supplies the coarse, low-frequency structure, while Nutmeg contributes the fine,
        high-frequency detail such as fur and whiskers. The filtering parameters control how sharply
        these two bands are separated and how strongly the high-frequency content is reintroduced
        into the final composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portrait is heavily blurred with a Gaussian filter, producing a smooth low-pass image in
        which small-scale details are suppressed but the overall facial geometry and shading remain
        intact. The image of Nutmeg is transformed into a high-pass signal by subtracting a softened
        version of itself, yielding an essentially zero-mean edge map dominated by sharp contours
        and texture. Before the two components are added, the high-pass layer is attenuated so that
        cat features are clearly visible at close range but do not overwhelm the underlying
        low-frequency portrait when the hybrid is viewed from farther away.

        The hybrid displays a clear dependence on viewing scale. At close range, the visual system
        preserves high spatial frequencies, and the edge layer therefore asserts itself through
        sharp textures and fine contours. As the image is reduced or viewed from a greater distance,
        these frequencies are progressively discarded, and the coarse structure of the underlying
        portrait becomes the principal object of perception. The Fourier plots render this shift in
        explicit form: the low-pass component gathers its energy near the spectral origin, the
        high-pass component disperses it into outer bands with marked directional organization, and
        the hybrid spectrum is nothing more than their superposition. The degree of blurring and the
        weight granted to the edge layer thus fix the partition of spatial scales between the two
        sources and determine which of them prevails in attention under different viewing
        conditions.

      <p>
        Additional hybrid pairs test whether the frequency-based separation used for the
        Derek–Nutmeg example generalizes to other combinations of content and texture. In each
        case, one source supplies the low-frequency structure—overall shape and illumination—while
        the other supplies high-frequency detail such as edges and fine surface variations. The
        construction is identical: a blurred version of the low-frequency source forms the base,
        a high-pass version of the second source is extracted by subtracting its blur, and an
        attenuated copy of this high-pass component is added to the base image.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        The first hybrid illustrates a pairing in which the low-frequency image has strong
        global geometry and the high-frequency image contributes localized detail that can be
        inspected up close. The second hybrid uses a different pair with more pronounced texture
        in the high-frequency source. In both cases, near viewing distances emphasize the edge
        layer from the high-frequency source, whereas increased distance or downsampling suppresses
        those components and reveals the low-frequency structure instead. The scale-dependent
        change in appearance therefore persists across distinct image pairs and is not confined to
        the original example.

        A Gaussian stack is obtained by repeatedly smoothing an image with a fixed Gaussian filter
        and recording each intermediate level. Successive levels therefore form a sequence in which
        high-frequency structure is progressively removed while coarse shading and shape are
        retained. A Laplacian stack is derived from this sequence by subtracting adjacent Gaussian
        levels; each Laplacian level then isolates a band of spatial frequencies, capturing
        structure that is present at one blur scale but absent at the next coarser one. The pair of
        stacks together decompose an image into a coarse base and a set of band-pass detail layers.

        The apple and orange stacks jointly demonstrate how Gaussian and Laplacian decompositions

        approach to a smooth, low-frequency representation as blur increases, whereas Laplacian
        stacks distribute edges and texture into distinct band-pass layers. Because the construction
        is linear and reconstructive, summing all Laplacian levels together with the coarsest
        Gaussian recovers the original image and supports multi-resolution manipulation of detail.

        the contribution of the apple on one side and the orange on the other; a blurred version of
        the mask ensures that the transition between sources extends over a finite region rather
        than being confined to a single column of pixels. The blending is performed level-wise for
        all bands and for the coarsest Gaussian residual.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each Laplacian level of the apple is multiplied by the corresponding mask level, each
        Laplacian level of the orange by one minus that level, and the weighted bands are added.
        The same operation is applied to the coarsest Gaussian level. The blended bands are then
        summed to reconstruct the final composite.

        The band-wise visualizations show that the blending operation is distributed over the full
        range of spatial scales. High-frequency bands enforce continuity of edges and texture,
        intermediate bands control the handoff of medium-scale structure, and coarse bands align
        global illumination and background tone. The mask stack governs the spatial extent of
        mixing at each level, and the sum of all blended bands with the coarsest Gaussian level
        reconstructs a composite that respects the local structure of both inputs while suppressing
        the artifacts that would result from a hard cut between them.

        The hard mask is progressively blurred as the level increases, so the transition band
        widens at coarser scales. High-frequency bands therefore change sources over a narrow band
        near the meridian, while low-frequency shading and background brightness change over a much
        broader region.
