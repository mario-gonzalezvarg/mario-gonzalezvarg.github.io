    <h2 class="section-heading">1.1 Convolutions from Scratch</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A discrete convolution is defined by sliding a small kernel across an image and, at each
        location, computing a weighted sum of the local neighborhood with zero-padding so that the
        output retains the spatial dimensions of the input. This operation implements a linear,
        shift-invariant filter whose effect is determined entirely by the choice of kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experiment compares three concrete realizations of this definition: a naïve four-loop
        baseline, a partially vectorized two-loop NumPy implementation, and SciPy’s optimized
        <code>convolve2d</code>. All three are applied to the same self-portrait with a 9×9 box
        filter, so any differences in outcome can be attributed to numerical or implementation
        details rather than to the underlying operator.

        A benchmark on the 9×9 box filter, averaged over multiple runs, yields runtimes of
        approximately 9066.8&nbsp;ms for the four-loop implementation, 1634.2&nbsp;ms for the
        two-loop implementation, and 70.5&nbsp;ms for the SciPy routine. The partially vectorized
        version is therefore faster than the naïve one by a factor of about 5.5, while SciPy
        achieves a speedup of roughly 129 over the four-loop baseline and about 23 over the
        two-loop method. The timing data establish that expressing convolution in terms of large
        array operations, rather than explicit Python loops, is decisive for efficiency.

        The three filtered selfies smooth high-frequency detail in the hair, pavement, and jacket
        while preserving coarse structure such as the outline of the face and the bike rack. The
        outputs are visually indistinguishable, and any discrepancies are below the level of
        perceptual relevance. Together with the timing measurements, this shows that the custom
        NumPy implementations are numerically consistent with the library routine and differ
        principally in computational cost rather than in filtering behavior.

  <!-- =============================== 1.3 Derivative of Gaussian Filter ================================= -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">1.3 Derivative of Gaussian Filter</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        We now explore two strategies for computing smoothed image gradients: first blurring
        the image with a Gaussian filter and then applying finite-difference kernels, versus
        convolving once with derivative-of-Gaussian (DoG) kernels. Since convolution is linear and
        shift-invariant, differentiating the Gaussian and then convolving the result with the image
        should be equivalent, up to numerical and boundary effects, to convolving with the Gaussian
        followed by discrete differentiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Horizontal and vertical derivative-of-Gaussian kernels are constructed and applied to the
        cameraman image. The resulting directional derivatives and gradient magnitudes are
        juxtaposed with those obtained from the “smooth then difference” pipeline. The comparison
        tests whether the one-step DoG approach reproduces the same sharpened edges and reduced
        noise as the two-stage method that explicitly separates smoothing and differentiation.

    <h2 class="section-heading">2.1 Image Sharpening with Unsharp Masking</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        This section analyzes unsharp masking as a method for enhancing fine detail in a photograph
        of the Taj Mahal. The procedure forms a smoothed version of the image by convolving with a
        Gaussian blur kernel, subtracts this low-pass version from the original to isolate a
        high-pass component containing edges and textures, and then adds a scaled copy of this
        high-pass signal back to the original. The sharpened image exhibits increased local
        contrast near boundaries while largely preserving the global brightness and coloration of
        the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpreted in terms of kernels, unsharp masking combines an impulse-like identity kernel
        with a negative Gaussian to create an effective filter with a strong positive center and a
        weaker negative surround. This structure amplifies rapid spatial changes and slightly
        suppresses slowly varying regions. The intermediate visualizations of the blur, the
        extracted high-pass component, the sharpened output, and the equivalent single unsharp
        kernel clarify how the operation redistributes contrast across spatial scales.

        The Taj Mahal and vintage photograph examples together show how unsharp masking parameters
        fix the notion of “detail” that is being enhanced. A narrower blur sharpens fine
        architectural edges in a high-resolution scene, whereas a broader blur applied to the scan
        targets mid-scale structure and prevents film grain from becoming visually dominant. In
        both cases, the method operates by selectively boosting high-frequency content relative to
        a smooth background, producing images that appear more focused without resorting to a
        simple global contrast adjustment.

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A hybrid image combines the low frequencies of one photograph with the high frequencies of
        another so that perception changes with viewing distance. In this example, Derek’s face
        supplies the coarse, low-frequency structure, while Nutmeg contributes the fine,
        high-frequency detail such as fur and whiskers. The filtering parameters control how sharply
        these two bands are separated and how strongly the high-frequency content is reintroduced
        into the final composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portrait is heavily blurred with a Gaussian filter, producing a smooth low-pass image in
        which small-scale details are suppressed but the overall facial geometry and shading remain
        intact. The image of Nutmeg is transformed into a high-pass signal by subtracting a softened
        version of itself, yielding an essentially zero-mean edge map dominated by sharp contours
        and texture. Before the two components are added, the high-pass layer is attenuated so that
        cat features are clearly visible at close range but do not overwhelm the underlying
        low-frequency portrait when the hybrid is viewed from farther away.

        The hybrid displays a clear dependence on viewing scale. At close range, the visual system
        preserves high spatial frequencies, and the edge layer therefore asserts itself through
        sharp textures and fine contours. As the image is reduced or viewed from a greater distance,
        these frequencies are progressively discarded, and the coarse structure of the underlying
        portrait becomes the principal object of perception. The Fourier plots render this shift in
        explicit form: the low-pass component gathers its energy near the spectral origin, the
        high-pass component disperses it into outer bands with marked directional organization, and
        the hybrid spectrum is nothing more than their superposition. The degree of blurring and the
        weight granted to the edge layer thus fix the partition of spatial scales between the two
        sources and determine which of them prevails in attention under different viewing
        conditions.

        Additional hybrid pairs test whether the frequency-based separation used for the
        Derek–Nutmeg example generalizes to other combinations of content and texture. In each
        case, one source supplies the low-frequency structure—overall shape and illumination—while
        the other supplies high-frequency detail such as edges and fine surface variations. The
        construction is identical: a blurred version of the low-frequency source forms the base,
        a high-pass version of the second source is extracted by subtracting its blur, and an
        attenuated copy of this high-pass component is added to the base image.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        The first hybrid illustrates a pairing in which the low-frequency image has strong
        global geometry and the high-frequency image contributes localized detail that can be
        inspected up close. The second hybrid uses a different pair with more pronounced texture
        in the high-frequency source. In both cases, near viewing distances emphasize the edge
        layer from the high-frequency source, whereas increased distance or downsampling suppresses
        those components and reveals the low-frequency structure instead. The scale-dependent
        change in appearance therefore persists across distinct image pairs and is not confined to
        the original example.

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A Gaussian stack is defined as a sequence of images <em>G<sub>0</sub>, …, G<sub>K</sub></em>
        generated by repeated convolution with the same Gaussian kernel. The base level
        <em>G<sub>0</sub></em> is the original image; each subsequent level
        <em>G<sub>k+1</sub></em> is obtained by smoothing <em>G<sub>k</sub></em>. Increasing the
        index <em>k</em> removes higher spatial frequencies and leaves progressively lower ones
        unchanged, so the stack organizes the image by scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this sequence one defines a Laplacian stack
        <em>L<sub>k</sub> = G<sub>k</sub> − G<sub>k+1</sub></em>. Each Laplacian level records the
        change incurred when passing from blur scale <em>k</em> to <em>k+1</em> and is therefore
        band-limited: it contains structure that is present at one scale but not at the next
        coarser scale. The original image satisfies the reconstruction identity
        <em>G<sub>0</sub> = G<sub>K</sub> + Σ<sub>k=0</sub><sup>K−1</sup> L<sub>k</sub></em>, so the
        decomposition is linear and lossless.

      In the Gaussian stacks for the apple and orange, small values of <em>k</em> preserve fine
      texture: sensor noise, skin blemishes, and pore structure are clearly visible. As
      <em>k</em> increases, these high-frequency components are attenuated and only slowly varying
      intensity patterns remain. The silhouette, the division between fruit and background, and a
      small number of broad highlight regions persist even in the deepest blur. The progression
      across levels is thus governed by a single principle: at each step, the admissible frequency
      band is restricted while spatial alignment of large-scale features is preserved.

        intermediate levels isolate the main fruit contour and the core of the specular highlight;
        coarsest levels contain only gentle transitions between fruit, table, and background. Each
        <em>L<sub>k</sub></em> is localized in scale: it vanishes at much finer and much coarser

        Together, the Gaussian and Laplacian stacks provide a complete account of how image
        information is distributed across scale. The Gaussian stack describes the state of the
        image after progressively discarding detail; the Laplacian stack specifies, level by level,
        which detail has been discarded. Later multiresolution procedures operate by manipulating or mixing selected Laplacian bands
        while leaving others fixed, thereby changing the allocation of structure across scales
        without violating the reconstruction identity.

        The band-wise visualizations show that the blending operation is distributed over the full
        range of spatial scales. High-frequency bands enforce continuity of edges and texture,
        intermediate bands control the handoff of medium-scale structure, and coarse bands align
        global illumination and background tone. The mask stack governs the spatial extent of
        mixing at each level, and the sum of all blended bands with the coarsest Gaussian level
        reconstructs a composite that respects the local structure of both inputs while suppressing
        the artifacts that would result from a hard cut between them.

        at the coarsest level they retain only the slow variation of infrared brightness across the disc. Wherever the

        The GA bands show the effect of combining sources at each scale under the mask. High-frequency GA levels already
        exhibit infrared-bright structures embedded in visible cloud detail, while coarse GA levels show a smooth
        transition from an infrared-dominated core to a visible-dominated periphery. Adding all GA levels together with
        the coarsest Gaussian residual reconstructs a single fused view of Jupiter in which central emission follows the
        infrared data and the outer atmosphere follows the visible data, without discontinuities across scale.

        The LA bands contain Charon’s relief, from fine crater rims and ridges at the finest level
        to broad albedo and limb-darkening variations at coarser levels. These structures will
        occupy the left hemisphere of the final blend wherever the mask weight is close to one.

        The LB bands play the same role for Earth’s Moon on the right hemisphere. High levels carry
        its finest crater detail, lower levels carry mare–highland contrast and global illumination.
        Blending LA and LB under the mask at each scale yields a sphere with spatially consistent
        relief but different geology on each side.

        The GA bands show the effect of masking at each scale: fine bands already display a clean
        left–right split in crater detail, and coarse bands show a smooth transition in shading and
        background tone. Their sum, together with the coarsest Gaussian level, reconstructs the
        final blended planet.

        The hard mask is progressively blurred as the level increases, so the transition band
        widens at coarser scales. High-frequency bands therefore change sources over a narrow band
        near the meridian, while low-frequency shading and background brightness change over a much
        broader region.
