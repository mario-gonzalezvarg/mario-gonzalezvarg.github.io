    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        A Gaussian stack is obtained by repeatedly smoothing an image with a fixed Gaussian filter
        and recording each intermediate level. Successive levels therefore form a sequence in which
        high-frequency structure is progressively removed while coarse shading and shape are
        retained. A Laplacian stack is derived from this sequence by subtracting adjacent Gaussian
        levels; each Laplacian level then isolates a band of spatial frequencies, capturing
        structure that is present at one blur scale but absent at the next coarser one. The pair of
        stacks together decompose an image into a coarse base and a set of band-pass detail layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        These constructions are examined on two objects of similar shape but different texture and
        coloration: an apple and an orange. The Gaussian stacks describe how each fruit’s large-scale
        form and illumination emerge as small-scale variations are suppressed, while the Laplacian
        stacks localize the edges and surface irregularities into distinct frequency bands that are
        useful for blending and multi-resolution editing.

        The apple and orange stacks together illustrate how Gaussian and Laplacian decompositions
        separate images into complementary descriptions across scale. The Gaussian stacks record
        how each object approaches a smooth, low-frequency representation as blur increases,
        whereas the Laplacian stacks distribute edges and texture into distinct band-pass layers.
        Because the construction is linear and reconstructive—summing all Laplacian levels plus the
        coarsest Gaussian recovers the original image—it provides a principled basis for
        multi-resolution operations such as blending, tone manipulation, and detail transfer that
        act selectively on specific spatial scales.
