  <!-- ========== B.1: Corner Detection (Harris + ANMS) ========== -->
  <section class="content gold-glass iteration-belt" id="b1">
    <h2 class="section-heading">B.1 Corner Detection</h2>

    <div class="iteration-belt__intro">
      <p>
        Corner detection can be decomposed into two judgments: where the image contains two-directional variation, and
        which
        of those locations should be retained as a stable basis for later matching. The Harris response supplies the
        first
        judgment by measuring whether local gradients provide evidence of structure in more than one direction; a high
        score
        is interpreted as a location whose appearance is locally informative rather than edge-like or flat. The Harris
        map, taken alone, does not enforce a useful distribution. Dense clusters occur whenever repeated texture
        generates many neighboring pixels with similar scores, so the raw output is often an over-complete description
        of a
        single region. Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS) supplies the second judgment by trading quantity for
        coverage:
        points are retained when they remain strong while also being far from stronger competitors, which spreads the
        set
        across the object and reduces redundancy.

        The two images in each pair serve as a diagnostic. The Harris visualization indicates the underlying “evidence
        field”
        (where the image claims to have corners), while the ANMS visualization indicates whether that evidence can be
        converted into a spatially balanced set that will not collapse downstream matching into a single textured patch.

        The green glass sculpture is a difficult corner source because local appearance is less stable. Translucency and
        internal refraction generate view-dependent highlights and low-frequency intensity drift, and darker regions
        reduce
        signal-to-noise; both effects weaken the gradient evidence that Harris relies on. Increasing
        <code>max-harris</code>
        to 10000 preserves more marginal candidates so that ANMS can still extract a reasonably distributed set of 450
        points
        without collapsing onto a few bright highlight boundaries.

        The red glass sculpture provides stronger, more repeatable corner evidence because the dominant cues are stable
        surface boundaries and consistent shading transitions. The Harris field therefore contains more clearly
        separated
        maxima, so fewer raw candidates (<code>max-harris</code> = 6000) are sufficient, and ANMS can retain a smaller
        set
        (350) while still maintaining broad coverage across the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failures concentrate where the premise of “corner stability” is violated. Specular highlights can create corners
        that move with viewpoint rather than with geometry; repeated micro-texture can produce many near-duplicates that
        remain locally strong but do not add new information; and low-texture regions can leave ANMS with little
        evidence to
        distribute. Success is most reliable when the selected points lie on rigid, high-contrast geometry whose
        gradient
        structure persists under small viewpoint changes.

 <!-- ========== B.2: Feature Descriptors ========== -->

      Descriptor extraction can be reduced to three operations: sampling a neighborhood around each retained corner,
      canonicalizing that neighborhood into a fixed-dimensional representation, and comparing representations by a
      distance rule. The purpose of canonicalization is not aesthetic compression, but invariance: a match should be
      driven by local structure that persists across views rather than by absolute exposure or global tone.

      Two diagnostic visualizations are used to judge whether the descriptor is behaving as intended. The <em>descriptor
      points</em> image shows coverage, whether samples span the object and the overlap region instead of collapsing into a
      single cluster. The <em>descriptor patches</em> grid shows discriminability, whether the encoded neighborhoods contain
      stable edges/corners or instead devolve into flat, noisy, or highlight-dominated templates that cannot support
      reliable matching.

      Again, we emphasize how the green glass case is systematically harder because the local evidence is less repeatable. Translucency introduces
      view-dependent highlights and internal refraction, so a patch centered at the “same” geometric location can change its
      intensity layout between views. Dark regions additionally reduce signal-to-noise; after per-patch normalization, small
      sensor noise can be scaled into meaningful-looking contrast, which makes some templates appear distinctive while not
      being stable.

      The red glass case is comparatively cooperative because a larger fraction of the neighborhood structure is anchored

      across viewpoint changes.

      Descriptor failure concentrates in (1) low-texture neighborhoods that collapse to noise after normalization,
      (2) repeated micro-structure where many patches are genuinely similar and therefore ambiguous, and

      when the neighborhood contains rigid, high-contrast geometry that preserves its gradient structure across views.
